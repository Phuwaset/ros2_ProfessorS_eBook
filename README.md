```bash
  mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
  cd ~/ros2_ws
```
## 
## Source an underlay = ros2_ws

## build

colcon build --symlink-install

```bash
  colcon build --symlink-install
```

  colcon test
```

## Source the environment

When colcon has completed building successfully, the output will be in the install directory.

## Resolve dependencies

From the root of your workspace (ros2_ws), run the following command

```bash
  rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y

If you already have all your dependencies, the console will return:
```bash
  #All required rosdeps installed successfully
```
